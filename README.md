Solar Spectrum Line Plotter
===============

Initial release of solar spectrum line plotter. Uses CHIANTI database to generate a model solar spectrum from 0.01 to 10.00 keV. 

Note: to use in conjunction with other Chandra-related models, be sure to set the line width to 0.05 keV as this is the approximate resolution of Chandra.
